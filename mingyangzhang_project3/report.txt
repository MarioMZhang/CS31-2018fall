main obstacle:
how to distinguish the mistakes one by one.
find the proper way to track each character.(in the first attempt, I missed several characters leading to a logic error)

******************************************************************************************
pseudocode:

function hasProperSyntax:
repeatedly check the characters in the pollData string to record the numbers of letters, digits, and comma, and to convert all the letters to uppercase letters
Compare the sum of them to the total length of the string pollData
	Return false if they are not the same, which means there are characters other than digits, letters or comma.

If the string is empty, return true
if the string size is 1, return false 
	then check if the first 2 characters in the string is a valid state code
		if not, return false
		if so, check if the total length of the string equals to 2
			if so, return true, in this scenario, the string contain only a state code 

Starting from the third character, repeatedly check if the character is a comma
	if so, check if the comma is the last character or the second last character of the string, and check if the following two characters are a valid state code.
	if the character is not a comma, then check if it is a digit
		if so, check if the next character is digit
			if so or not, check if the next one is a letter
				if not, return false since there is a wrong party code
Return true if no error occurs



Function tallySeats:

Check if the format of pollData is valid 
	if not, return 1
Check if the party code is valid 
	if not, return 2
If both of them are correct, compare every character in pollData with the party code, and check if the former character and the second former are digits
	record the sum of number represented by the digits if apply
	Return 0 and save the sum for seatTally

Test data for function hasProperSyntax:

wrong pollData with space after the comma(Ct13e, ca9i7s)
wrong pollData with only one letter, inducting wrong state code(a)
wrong pollData with wrong state code(DS9e8f,MT8s12s)
wrong pollData with space between digit and party code(CA4 D)
wrong pollData with no party code(Ga6,nV3o)
wrong pollData with comma at the beginning(,Ut8x)
wrong pollData with comma in the end(Ut8x,)
wrong pollData with two comma together(SD9u17I,,OK09R6a)
wrong pollData with undefined symbol(!ca8u)
wrong pollData with three digits before the party code(ca100d7u,CT9i)
wrong pollData with no digits between party code(ca22ai)

true pollData(CT5D,NY9R17D1I,VT,ne3r00D), (CA7U8o,Ky8s8w00x,wY90D), (SD9u17I,OK09R6a), (me),(), (vT9D)
assert(hasProperSyntax("CT5D,NY9R17D1I,VT,ne3r00D"));
assert(hasProperSyntax("Ca7q,ca9s,vt3d"));
		
Test data for function tallySeats:

wrong pollData return 1 ("cd9d0w8c",'c',-111), ("a9x0ex",'x',-222), ("Ct13e, ca9i7s", 's',-999)
wrong party code return 2("Ca8d9x,ct9u23d",'#', -333), ("SD9u17I,OK09R6a",'!',-222)

Valid inputs, check the number of seats("Ca8d9x,ct9u23d",'d', -333), ("CA7U8o,Ky8s8w00x,wY90D",'x',-111), ("Ca7q,ca9s,vt3d",'q',-222)
empty pollData, and valid party code return 0 and set seats to 0 ("", 's', -222)
